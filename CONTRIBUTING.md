# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Kedro-Viz! We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests, issues or code reviews. You can add to code, or simply send us spelling and grammar fixes or extra tests. Contribute anything that you think improves the community for us all!

The following sections describe our vision and the contribution process.

## Code of conduct

The Kedro team pledges to foster and maintain a welcoming and friendly community in all of our spaces. All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and we will do our best to enforce those principles and build a happy environment where everyone is treated with respect and dignity.

# Get started

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz/issues) to keep track of known bugs. We keep a close eye on them and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before reporting a new issue, please do your best to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than create a new one. Old issues also can often include helpful tips and solutions to common problems.

If you are looking for help with your code, please consider posting a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kedro-viz) or our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/4qeKKspFf8).

If you have already checked the [existing issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz/issues) on GitHub and are still convinced that you have found odd or erroneous behaviour then please file a [new issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz/issues/new/choose). We have a template that helps you provide the necessary information we'll need in order to address your query.

## Feature requests

### Suggest a new feature

If you have new ideas for Kedro-Viz functionality then please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz/issues) with the label `Type: Enhancement`. Please describe in your own words the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Contribute a new feature

If you're unsure where to begin contributing to Kedro-Viz, please start by looking through the `good first issues` and `Request: Help Wanted` on [GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz/issues).

Typically, small contributions to Kedro-Viz are more preferable due to an easier review process, but we accept any new features if they prove to be essential for the functioning of the plugin or if we believe that they are used by most projects.

# Contribution guidelines

## General guidelines

> **Note**: We only accept contributions under the [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) license and you should have permission to share the submitted code.

- Aim for cross-platform compatibility on Windows, macOS and Linux, and support recent versions of major browsers
- We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning
- Our code is designed to be compatible with Python 3.8 onwards
- We use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) as a preferred virtual environment
- We use [PEP 8 conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for all Python code
- We use [Google docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for code comments
- We use [PEP 484 type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) for all user-facing functions / class methods e.g.

```
def count_truthy(elements: List[Any]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for elem in elements if elem)
```

- Keep UI elements fully keyboard accessible, and aim to support screen-readers where possible
- Maintain a high level of animation performance, and minimise page-load time
- Comply with the set of colours defined in the [Kedro-Viz Style Guide](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-viz/blob/main/STYLE_GUIDE.md) for all colour variables and usage

## Git branching guidelines

- We practice [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).
- We bias towards small, complete pieces of work that can be merged into the trunk. "Complete" is defined as:
  - A working user-journey, however small
  - A backward-compatible change that paves the way for future features implementations
  - A non-breaking refactoring of the code
  - Note: to be considered complete, the branch must include tests (end to end or unit tests) for the newly introduced feature or fix
- We embrace freedom to make exception when absolutely necessary.
- We use a naming convention that helps us keep track of branches in a logical, consistent way. All branches should have the hyphen-separated convention of: `<type-of-change>/<short-description-of-change>` e.g. `feature/awesome-new-feature`.

| Types of changes | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs`           | Changes to the documentation of the plugin                                  |
| `feature`        | Non-breaking change which adds functionality                                |
| `chore`          | Non-breaking change which updates UX, UI, dependencies, etc.                |
| `fix`            | Non-breaking change which fixes an issue                                    |
| `tests`          | Changes to project unit (`tests/`) and / or integration (`features/`) tests |

## Developer Certificate of Origin

We require that all contributions comply with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). This certifies that the contributor wrote or otherwise has the right to submit their contribution.

All commits must be signed off by including a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message:

```
This is my commit message
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

The sign-off can be added automatically to your commit message using the `-s` option:

```bash
git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```

To avoid needing to remember the `-s` flag on every commit, you might like to set up an [alias](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) for `git commit -s`. Alternatively, run `make sign-off` to setup a [`commit-msg` Git hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_commit_msg) that automatically signs off all commits (including merge commits) you make while working on the Kedro-Viz repository.

## PR authoring guidelines

- PRs for releasable changes must always be made against `main`. As per Trunk-based Development convention, `main` branch must always be releasable.
- PRs must update the release note for the upcoming release with details about the change.
- Request review on a PR only as the PR is fully ready for review, i.e. no debugging statement, no stylistic non-compliance.
- Publish a draft PR if you need informal, fast feedback on a work in progress.
- A demo build of frontend changes is automatically created at `http://kedro-viz-fe.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/<your-branch-name>` for every new branch.
- Make sure you tick items in the PR checklist as appropriate.

## PR review guidelines

- Focus on correctness, as opposed to nit-picking
- Strive for consistency with existing codebase
- Disagree and commit fast before discussion derails to bike shedding
- Mark optional review suggestions with `Optional` or `Nit`. These suggestions should still be respected, discussed and resolved, but the PR author can choose to disagree
- Assume review suggestions and questions are made from a helpful, knowledge-sharing, collaborative frame by default
- Normalise pointing out improvements unrelated to the current PR in review, then file a GitHub issue to resolve it in another PR

## Development guidelines

### JavaScript development

_*Note*: We suggest using the [latest release of Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/) in your development environment._

First clone this repo, then download and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now you're ready to begin development. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will serve the app at [localhost:4141](http://localhost:4141/), and watch files in `/src` for changes. It will also update the `/lib` directory, which contains a Babel-compiled copy of the source. This directory is exported to `npm`, and is used when importing as a React component into another application. It is updated automatically when you save in case you need to test/debug it locally (e.g. with `npm link`). You can also update it manually, by running

```bash
npm run lib
```

Lastly, we have in place a pre-commit and pre-push hook. Before committing, the pre-commit hook will lint and prettify your changed files. Before pushing those committed changes, the pre-push hook will run our JavaScript test suite. This ensures the local changes haven't caused any breakages, and if they have, you'll be notified and can remedy then and there (note: you may need to restart your code editor or source control application for these hooks to work properly).

### Data sources

Kedro-Viz uses a unique identifier to determine the data source from one of several available sources. You can configure this by appending a query string to the URL, e.g. `http://localhost:4141/?data=random`. Alternatively, you can set it with an environment variable when starting up the dev server:

```bash
DATA=random npm start
```

These are the supported dataset identifiers:

| Identifier       | Data source                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `json` (default) | `/public/api/main`                       |
| `random`         | Randomly-generated data                  |
| `demo`           | `/src/utils/data/demo.mock.js`           |
| `spaceflights`   | `/src/utils/data/spaceflights.mock.json` |

By default in production, the app asynchronously loads JSON from the `/api/main` endpoint. You can replicate this in development by placing a JSON dataset in `/public/api/main`, using `main` as the name of the file, [without an extension](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch002089.htm). Note that operating systems often add hidden file extensions, so you might need to use a CLI to confirm the filename.

Alternatively, you can synchronously load one of the mock datasets in `/src/utils/data`. The 'spaceflights' dataset is mainly used as mock data for unit testing.

Finally, you can use pseudo-random data, which is procedurally-generated on page load, and is often useful for local development. Random data can be seeded with a hash string, which will allow you to replicate a generated layout. You can supply a seed with a `seed` query string in the URL, e.g. `http://localhost:4141/?data=random&seed=oM4xauN4Whyse`. If you do not supply a seed query to the URL, the app will generate a new pseudo-random seed on every browser refresh, and will output it to the browser console in case you wish to reuse it.

### Launch a development server with a real Kedro project

> **Note**: Kedro-Viz>=7.0.0 will not work with projects created with Kedro<=0.17.0. Please consider migrating your project to Kedro>=0.18.0 before you develop against the latest version of Kedro-Viz.


Before launching a development server with a real Kedro project, you'd need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/)(>=3.8) installed. We strongly recommend setting up [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your Python versions and virtual environments. You can visit Kedro's [guide to installing conda](https://docs.kedro.org/en/latest/get_started/install.html#create-a-virtual-environment-for-your-kedro-project) for more information.

The Kedro-Viz repository comes with an example project in the `demo-project` folder. This is used on the [public demo](https://demo.kedro.org/). To use it in your development environment, you need to install both the Kedro-Viz dependencies and a minimal set of dependencies for the demo project:

```bash
pip3 install -r package/test_requirements.txt -r demo-project/src/docker_requirements.txt
```

Now build the application with:

```bash
make build
```

As far as the development server for the backend is concerned, you only need to run `make build` once when you first setup the project. You can then launch the server with:

```bash
make run
```

This command will launch a Kedro-Viz backend server at [localhost:4142](http://localhost:4142) and serve data from `demo-project`. If you wish to also launch the frontend app then execute `npm start` in a separate terminal window. [localhost:4141](http://localhost:4141) will then pull data from the backend Kedro-Viz server that is running on port 4142.

If you wish to point the backend server to a different Kedro project then you can do so by altering the `PROJECT_PATH` variable:

```bash
make run PROJECT_PATH=<path-to-your-test-project>/new-kedro-project
```

> **Note**: Once the backend development server is launched at port 4142, the local app will always pull data from that server. To prevent this, you can comment out the proxy setting in `package.json` and restart the dev server at port 4141.

#### Launch the development server with the `SQLiteSessionStore`

Kedro-Viz provides a `SQLiteSessionStore` that users can use in their project to enable experiment tracking functionality. If you want to use this session store with the development server, make sure you don't use a relative path when specifying the store's location in `settings.py`. For example, `demo-project` specifies the local `data` directory within a project as the session store's location as follows:

```python
from kedro_viz.integrations.kedro.sqlite_store import SQLiteStore
SESSION_STORE_ARGS = {"path": str(Path(__file__).parents[2] / "data")}
```

Owing to this coupling between the project settings and Kedro-Viz, if you wish to execute any Kedro commands on `demo-project` (including `kedro run`), you will need to install the Kedro-Viz Python package. To install your local development version of the package, run:

```bash
pip3 install -e package
```

Since Kedro 0.18, a session can only contain one run. In Kedro-Viz, once a session has been retrieved from the store we always use the terminology "run" rather than "session", e.g. `run_id` rather than `session_id`.

## Testing guidelines

- Scope out major journeys from acceptance criteria from the ticket for manual end-to-end testing
- Write any other necessary tests (e.g. unit tests, snapshot tests, etc.) needed to give us enough confidence on the implementation

### JavaScript unit and component tests

Kedro-Viz uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running JavaScript tests, with [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) and [Testing-Library](https://testing-library.com/) to mount React components and mock the DOM. You can run tests as follows:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also [inspect and debug tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/debugging-tests):

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

And [check test coverage](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests#coverage-reporting):

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

See the [Create-React-App docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for further information on JS testing.

### JavaScript end-to-end tests

Kedro-Viz uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for running JavaScript end-to-end tests. All the Kedro-Viz dependencies need to be installed before running the tests.

- [Javascript dependencies](#javascript-development) 
- [Python dependencies](#launch-a-development-server-with-a-real-kedro-project)

Run end-to-end tests using the below command:

```bash
npm run cy:test
```

You can also run Cypress in head mode for active development. Please note that you need to start your frontend and backend applications separately before running the below command.

```bash
npm run cy:dev
```

### Testing package imports

You can simulate how the published package will behave when imported into another JavaScript application by running

```bash
npm run lib-test
```

This script uses `npm pack` to package Kedro-Viz as a tarball, then copies it to a boilerplate React app in `/tools/test-lib/react-app` and installs it. Next, the script runs a simple server at `http://localhost:1337`, which will open in the browser so that you can check that everything is working as it should.

You can also run automated tests on this demo app by copying and installing the tarball package, navigating to the test directory and running Jest:

```bash
npm run lib-test:setup
cd tools/test-lib/react-app
npm test
```

### Python web server tests

Before running Python tests, install test requirements:

```bash
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
```

#### Unit tests, 100% coverage (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`)

```bash
make pytest
```

#### End-to-end tests (`behave`)

```bash
make e2e-tests
```

#### Linting tests (`isort`, `black`, `pylint`, `flake8` and `mypy`)

```bash
make lint
```

### Managing Python dependencies on Kedro-viz 

Python dependencies in Kedro-Viz are usually updated automatically through tools like Dependabot or triggered by deprecation warnings. When updating dependencies, especially the lower-bound version, it's essential to also update the `lower-requirements.txt` file manually. This ensures that our e2e tests reflect the latest dependencies, maintaining project stability and compatibility.

If the lower-bound e2e test fails, it indicates that some dependencies may not work correctly with Kedro-Viz. To resolve this, update the problematic dependency in both `requirements.txt` and `lower-requirements.txt`.

# Release guidelines

- Practice frequent, staggered releases.

## Release process

- Create a branch for release. The branch name should follow the pattern `release/* (e.g. release/6.4.0)`
- Update [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) with the latest release note. 

> _Note_: The heading for the release note should follow the pattern `# Release <release-number> (e.g. # Release 6.4.0)`
- Bump the release version number by running:

```bash
make version VERSION=<version-to-release>
```

> _Notes_: Kedro-Viz uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as the versioning scheme.

- Commit, raise a PR and get it merged into `main`.
- Once the release commit is in `main`, a GitHub action gets triggered which automatically publishes a release with a version tag and release notes based on [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).

> _Note_: The release tag corresponds to `__version__` from `package/kedro_viz/__init__.py` and the release notes is the content under the heading `# Release <release-number> (e.g. # Release 6.4.0)` in [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md).

- Once the release tag is published on GitHub, a CircleCI job will be triggered to push it to npm and PyPI accordingly.
- Once the new version is on PyPI, you can deploy it to https://demo.kedro.org by merging `main` into the `demo` branch. A CI job will automatically build a container using the [demo project](./demo-project) with the newly released version and deploy it.

```bash
git checkout demo
git merge main
git push
```
