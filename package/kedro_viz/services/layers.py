def sort_layers(
    nodes: Dict[str, GraphNode], dependencies: Dict[str, Set[str]]
) -> List[str]:
    """Given a DAG represented by a dictionary of nodes, some of which have a `layer` attribute,
    along with their dependencies, return the list of all layers sorted according to
    the nodes' topological order, i.e. a layer should appear before another layer in the list
    if its node is a dependency of the other layer's node, directly or indirectly.

    For example, given the following graph:
        node1(layer=a) -> node2 -> node4 -> node6(layer=d)
                            |                   ^
                            v                   |
                        node3(layer=b) -> node5(layer=c)
    The layers ordering should be: [a, b, c, d]

    In theory, this is a problem of finding the
    [transitive closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_closure) in a graph of layers
    and then toposort them. The algorithm below follows a repeated depth-first search approach:
        * For every node, find all layers that depends on it in a depth-first search.
        * While traversing, build up a dictionary of {node_id -> layers} for the node
        that have already been visited.
        * Turn the final {node_id -> layers} into a {layer -> layers} to represent the layers'
        dependencies. Note: the key is a layer and the values are the parents of that layer,
        just because that's the format TopologicalSorter requires.
        * Takes layers dictionary to ``graphlib.TopologicalSorter`` and return the sorted values.
        * Raise CycleError if the layers cannot be sorted topologically,
        i.e. there are cycles among the layers.

    Args:
        nodes: A dictionary of {node_id -> node} represents the nodes in the graph.
        dependencies: A dictionary of {node_id -> set(child_ids)}
            represents the direct dependencies between nodes in the graph.

    Returns:
        The list of layers sorted based on topological order.

    Raises:
        CycleError: When the layers have cyclic dependencies.
