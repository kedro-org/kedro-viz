# Platform-agnostic sharing with Kedro-Viz 

In Kedro-Viz version 7.1.0, we introduced the `kedro viz build` command that enables you to publish and share Kedro-Viz to any static website hosting platform. Running this command from the command line interface (CLI) creates a `build` folder within the Kedro project. The build folder contains a static Kedro-Viz app package, which can be used as a source to publish on any static website hosting platform.

## Install Kedro
If you haven't installed Kedro {doc}`follow the documentation to get set up<kedro:get_started/install>`. 

```{important}
We recommend that you use the same version of Kedro that was most recently used to test this tutorial (0.19.0). To check the version installed, type `kedro -V` in your terminal window.
```

In your terminal window, navigate to the folder you want to store the project. Generate the spaceflights tutorial project with all the code in place by using the [Kedro starter for the spaceflights tutorial](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-starters/tree/main/spaceflights-pandas):


```bash
kedro new --starter=spaceflights-pandas
```

When prompted for a project name, you can enter anything, but we will assume `Spaceflights` throughout.

When your project is ready, navigate to the root directory of the project. Install the dependencies from the project root directory by typing the following in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

Kedro-Viz requires specific minimum versions of `fsspec[s3]`, and `kedro` to publish your project. Ensure you have these correct versions by updating the `requirements.txt` file of the Kedro project to add the following:

```text
fsspec[s3]>=2023.9.0
kedro>=0.18.2
```

## Static website hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages

Follow the steps [listed in the GitHub pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to create a Git repository that supports GitHub Pages. On completion, push the contents of the `build` folder to this new repository. Your site will be available at the following URL: `http://<username>.github.io`
