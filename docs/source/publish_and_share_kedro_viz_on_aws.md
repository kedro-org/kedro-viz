# Publish and share on AWS

This page describes how to publish Kedro-Viz on AWS to share it with others. It uses the spaceflights tutorial as an example.

## Setup your kedro project 

If you haven't installed Kedro {doc}`follow the documentation to get set up<kedro:get_started/install>`. 

```{important}
We recommend that you use the same version of Kedro that was most recently used to test this tutorial (0.19.1). To check the version installed, type `kedro -V` in your terminal window.
```

In your terminal window, navigate to the folder you want to store the project. Generate the spaceflights tutorial project with all the code in place by using the [Kedro starter for the spaceflights tutorial](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-starters/tree/main/spaceflights-pandas):


```bash
kedro new --starter=spaceflights-pandas
```

When prompted for a project name, you can enter anything, but we will assume `Spaceflights` throughout.

When your project is ready, navigate to the root directory of the project. Install the dependencies from the project root directory by typing the following in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Kedro-Viz requires specific minimum versions of `fsspec`, and `kedro` to publish your project. Ensure you have these correct versions by updating the `requirements.txt` file of the Kedro project to add the following:

```text
fsspec>=2023.9.0
kedro>=0.18.2
```

## Install cloud dependencies

```bash
pip install 'kedro-viz[aws]'
```

## Configure your AWS S3 bucket

1. Create S3 bucket: Follow the [AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html) to create an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting.

```{note}
The process of uploading your site's files will be done through Kedro-Viz.
```

2. Set IAM user: Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and create an IAM user account. Refer to the official AWS documentation about [IAM Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html).

3. Generate access keys: Create an [IAM user groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups.html?icmpid=docs_iam_help_panel) with full access to the AWS S3 policy. Add the IAM user to the group and generate access keys. Refer to AWS documentation for detailed instructions on [creating and managing access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

## Set credentials

Once that's completed, you'll need to set your AWS credentials as environment variables in your terminal window, as shown below:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key_id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_access_key"
```

For more information, see the official AWS documentation about [how to work with credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html).


## Publish and share the project

Once your cloud storage is configured and the credentials are set, you are now ready to publish and share your Kedro-Viz project. 

### Publish and share via Kedro-Viz UI 

Start Kedro-Viz by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
kedro viz run
```

Navigate to the **Publish and share** icon located in the lower-left corner of the application interface. A modal dialog will appear, prompting you to select your hosting platform and provide your bucket name and endpoint link.

Set up endpoint
---------------

```{important}
The endpoint link can be found under **S3 bucket -> Properties -> Static website hosting -> Bucket website endpoint**.
```

Once those details are complete, click **Publish**. A hosted, shareable URL will be returned to you after the process completes.

```{note}
On Kedro-Viz version 7.0.0, you will see a modal dialog to select your region and bucket name.
```

### Publish and share via CLI

Use the `kedro viz deploy` command to publish Kedro-Viz on AWS. You can execute the following command from your project's root folder:

```bash
kedro viz deploy --platform=aws --endpoint=[s3-endpoint] --bucket-name=[s3-bucket-name]
```

If you are on Kedro-Viz 7.0.0 you can still publish and share Kedro-Viz project using the existing command 

```bash
kedro viz deploy --region=[aws-bucket-region] --bucket-name=[aws-bucket-name]
```

## Permissions and access control

Kedro-Viz does not manage permissions or access control. AWS manages all permissions and access control. As a user, you have the choice to allow anyone to view your project or restrict access to specific IP addresses, users, or groups.

Control who can access your visualization using [bucket and user policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-iam-policies.html) or [access control lists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acls.html). Refer to the official AWS documentation for further details.

## Billing

Kedro-Viz does not handle billing. You pay for storing objects in your S3 buckets. The amount you pay depends on your objectsâ€™ size, how long you stored the object during the month, and the storage class.

See the official [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/?nc=sn&loc=4) for more information.
