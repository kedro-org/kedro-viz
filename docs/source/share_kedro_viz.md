# Publish and share Kedro-Viz

The publish and share feature on Kedro-Viz enables seamless sharing of pipeline visualizations on any static website hosting platform. There are two methods:

1. **Platform-agnostic sharing with Kedro-Viz:** Use the `kedro viz build` command to publish Kedro-Viz on platforms like GitHub pages, sharing the generated URL. This is described in [Platform-agnostic sharing with Kedro-Viz](./platform_agnostic_sharing_with_kedro_viz)

2. **Publish and share Kedro-Viz automatically:** Use the `kedro viz deploy` command to automatically share Kedro-Viz on AWS, Azure, or GCP.  See detailed guides below:
* [Publish and share on AWS](./publish_and_share_kedro_viz_on_aws)
* [Publish and share on Azure](./publish_and_share_kedro_viz_on_azure)
