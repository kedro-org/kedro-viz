# Reporting modular pipeline

> *Note:* This `README.md` was generated using `Kedro 0.17.6` for illustration purposes. Please modify it according to your pipeline structure and contents.

The reporting pipeline provides 3 simple descriptive cuts from the `prm_shuttle_company_reviews` table:

|Plot name|Dataset type|Description|Image|
|-|-|-|-|
|Cancellation Policy Breakdown|Plotly|Provides a breakdown of the top countries by fleet price, broken down by flexible each of their cancellation policies are.|![bar](../../../../.tours/images/bar_chart.png)|
|Price histogram|Plotly|Provides a breakdown of how the different space shuttles compare from a price and scale point of view, broken down by engine type. |![hist](../../../../.tours/images/histogram.png)|
|Cancellation Policy Grid|Custom Pillow Image|This image is not something that we would really do in practice, but has been included mostly to show how easy it is in to define and use a [custom dataset](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/07_extend_kedro/03_custom_datasets.html) in Kedro. |![grid](../../../../.tours/images/grid.png)|
