## Migration guide from Kedro-Viz 2.\*.\* to Kedro-Viz 3.0.0

If you are just using Kedro-Viz with Kedro as a Python package, you won't need to do anything. The breaking changes in this release only affect the few users who are working on the application locally, or importing it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quantumblack/kedro-viz) and consuming it as a React component.

- The format for data passed to Kedro-Viz has changed. You can see examples of the new data format in the [`src/utils/data`](./src/utils/data) directory. The main change is that the format no longer supports multiple snapshots in a single dataset. Instead of [this](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-viz/blob/243fd1bb513023086e77bca9f8469e00d1182437/src/utils/data.mock.js):
  ```
  {
    snapshots: [
      {
        schema_id: '310750827599783',
        nodes: [...],
        edges: [...],
        tags: [...],
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
  You can now use something like [this](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-viz/blob/c75c499507617a01fb327c366b9d639229f1d921/src/utils/data/demo.mock.js):
  ```
  {
    nodes: [...],
    edges: [...],
    tags: [...],
  }
  ```
- The `showHistory`, `allowHistoryDeletion`, and `onDeleteSnapshot` props on the main App component have been deprecated. These no longer do anything, and can be removed.
- A new `parameters` value for the node `type` property has been created. This replaces the previous `is_parameters` Boolean property. To migrate previous data, find any nodes where `is_parameters: true`, and change the `type` value from `data` to `parameters`. e.g. from this:
  ```
  {
    tags: ['Nulla', 'pulvinar', 'enim', 'consectetur', 'volutpat'],
    id: 'task/consectetur',
    is_parameters: false,
    type: 'task',
    full_name: 'consectetur',
    name: 'consectetur'
  }
  ```
  to this:
  ```
  {
    tags: ['Nulla', 'pulvinar', 'enim', 'consectetur', 'volutpat'],
    id: 'task/consectetur',
    type: 'parameters',
    full_name: 'consectetur',
    name: 'consectetur'
  }
  ```

## Migration guide from Kedro-Viz 1.\*.\* to Kedro-Viz 2.0.0

- The data input format has been significantly changed. This will only affect users of the JavaScript package - regular Kedro users will not be affected. To see examples of the old API format compares to the new one, see the changes to `data.mock.js` in [this commit](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-viz/pull/8/files#diff-837826676eaada9374ec654c892af095).
